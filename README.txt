Thank you for this opportunity!

When I approached this assignment, I decided that I wanted to show my adaptability and willingness to learn new things.

This is my first time writing in Python. I did a self-taught "crash-course" to learn Python over the weekend,
and this solution is the product of my learning within a short period of time.
